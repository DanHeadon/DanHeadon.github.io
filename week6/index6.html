     <p1>Smart communications for growing companies.

Unfog Communications brings clarity to companies' mission, vision, and strategy. We clear the fog from the landscape so companies can show off where they're at, and see what's ahead.<!-- Hi, i'm Kerry, a marketing and communications professional focused primarily on technology companies. I enjoy working with small companies aiming to do big things, and helping them craft inspiring stories about why their work matters.
     Outside of work, I volunteer with Friends of the Urban Forest, Girls on the Run of the Bay Area, and the Taproot Foundation. I also run marathons (and relays), brew beer, hike the Bay Area, and hang out with my dog -->.</p1>
