<h2>BLOGGING & SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
<p>In six years of experience generating blog content and launching new blog programs for a variety of organizations, from ecommerce sites to market research firms, I've learned that one thing is key to blogging: passion. If you don't care about a topic, your audience won't either. Any social media program should be focused on providing real value to a specific audience, and has to grow out of true passion for a subject. While a certain amount of experimentation with exciting new social media tools is desirable, the core goal must be to create and share accurate, timely information that's relevant to readers and truly thrilling to the people posting on the blog.

My experience with blogging and social media has prepared me well to help create a functional blogging plan that will create community and build business for your company or organization. Contact me to discuss how I can help.</p>
